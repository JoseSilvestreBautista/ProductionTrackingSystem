# Production Tracking System


This program tracks and produces audio and visual products. The products can be added to the line of products available to be made. Then from the product line, individual products can be chosen to be produced in mass quantities. During mass production, each product is also given a serial number. The program also has an add an employee account page. <br />
This program was made individually by Jose Silvestre-Bautista.<br />
I made this program when at an intermediate level of programming.<br />
I made this program for a school assignment.<br />
I made this program at Florida Gulf Coast University during the start of my second year. <br /> 

## Demonstration
This a demo of the current capabilities of the program as of November 25, 2019. <br />

## Diagrams

These are all the classes in the program and there are some inheritance, classes that use the fields and methods of another class.  <br />

## Getting Started

Download an Idea such as Intellij. Make sure you have the Java 8 sdk and Java 8 jre.
Download the zip file version of the repository. Unzip and open through Intellij.

## Built With

I have used the follwing to create the program:<br/>

* Intellij
* jdk 8

Jdk 8 comes packaged with JavaFX, which allowed to create the program.

## Contributing

I can't wait to update this project!

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

* Inheritance: a subclass extending the fields and methods of a super class.
* Interface: a class that has fields and methods that are not initialized.
* regular expression: is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.
* Anonymous class: are nested classes with no name.
* Lambdas: express instances of functional interfaces
